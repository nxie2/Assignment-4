## Typography
I added two new typefaces 'Amatic SC', cursive and 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif because google says that these two fonts pair well together 
when Amatic SC', cursive is applied to all the headings or content above the main/body content, and 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif is applied to all the main content.

Also the website is a short introduction of a person, when 'Amatic SC', cursive and 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif are paired together it gives off a more serious vibe.

## Readability 
I changed the background color to grey and the text color to black to show contrast of the website. It helps readers to focus more on the content and when they read it they are less likely to get tired becasue the orginal blackground color yellow is boring.
